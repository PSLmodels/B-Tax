	abstract={In estimating the effects of capital income taxation, different studies measure different effective tax rates. This paper categorizes effective tax rate estimates into six basic types, and discusses the usefulness of each. For marginal effective tax rates, some studies estimate the additional taxes associated with a marginal increase in the inflation and interest rates, while others estimate the additional taxes associated with a marginal increase in investment. Because there are six basic types of rates, because of the different procedures that can be used to estimate each type, and because of different assumptions about the margin, care should be taken in the application and use of effective tax rate estimates.},

	abstract={The marginal effective tax rate, designed to measure incentives for investment, is a calculation that takes into account effects of measurement and timing of income in determining the impact of a tax applied to an additional dollar of capital income. The marginal effective tax rate on capital income is the expected pretax rate of return minus the expected after-tax rate of return on a new marginal investment, divided by the pretax rate of return.},
